# Section where you NEED to configure basic settings
# without which the plugin will not start
Service:

  # Defines what language will be used to send messages
  # You can translate language file by yourself
  # (and suggest your translation on our Discord server)
  # or use pre-translated supported languages files
  # List of supported languages ❘ https://windstudio.gitbook.io/discordwhitelist/step-by-step-setting/setting-up-our-bot
  Language: en_US

  # Should plugin send message about updates of a plugin
  # to a player(OP & Permission) and in console?
  Check-Updates: true

  # (Requires developer mode enabled)
  # These option let plugin know about server you're on,
  # so plugin will use it for its needs.
  # Copy your server ID using: RMB on your server -> click on COPY ID button
  ServerID: ReplaceThisWithYourServerID

  # You can find Bot Token on Discord Developer Portal ❘ https://discord.com/developers/applications
  # Some instructions how to configure this option:
  #  1 ❘ Go to Discord Developer Portal, create(or choose existing) bot
  #  2 ❘ Go to his settings, then go to 'Bot' page and enable in 'Privileged Gateway Intents' header: PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
  #  3 ❘ Scroll up and tap 'Reset bot token' button, then copy this token and replace 'ReplaceThisWithYourBotToken' with your token
  #  4 ❘ Save config and reload the server
  Token: ReplaceThisWithYourBotToken

  # Since plugin uses unique encryption system for every token,
  # plugin generate a unique password to access your token, so
  # you should enable this if you want to change your token to
  # let plugin generate new password for your new token.
  # Some instructions of usage:
  #  1 ❘ Turn off your server(or, if you use ReloadModule, you can keep server online)
  #  2 ❘ Go to config, then enable TokenReplacement(replace 'false' to 'true')
  #  3 ❘ Replace your current(encrypted) Token with new one
  #  4 ❘ Save your config, then you can enable server(or, if you use ReloadModule, reload plugin)
  # This feature will return to 'false' condition when encryption success
  TokenReplacement: false
